                <h2>Interview with General David H. Petraeus</h2>
                <p>By <b>Adam Friedman</b> - Washington, January 2021</p>
                <p class="phototextarticle">General Petraeus is an intriguing character. He lives a relentless life,
                    challenge, service and sacrifice meet as friendly acquaintances.

                    David Petraeus served for over 37 years in the US military. He commanded the Iraq troop surge under
                    President Bush; led the United States Central Command (2008-2010), one of the eleven unified
                    combatant units of the Department of Defence.</p>

                <br><br><br>
                <p class="phototextarticle"><b>General, you said in your New Yorker interview that the Western
                        intervention in
                        Afghanistan required more resources and crucially more time, but how do you believe that that
                        policy of prolongation could
                        be communicated to public opinion in the USA and the UK?</b><br>

                    “I think the key is to explain that among the lessons we have learned since the 9/11 attacks are
                    that we have to keep an eye and pressure on Islamist extremists, wherever they may be and even after
                    they have been defeated. What we learned after our withdrawal from Iraq, for example, is that an
                    extremist group that has been destroyed (as Al Qaeda in Iraq was during the Surge in Iraq) can
                    reconstitute itself (as ISIS, in that case) if we or the host nation take our eye off the group, as
                    Iraqi authorities did after our departure.”</p>

                <p class="phototextarticle"><b>Do you believe that the USA’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan has
                        the potential to stimulate a
                        serious discussion in Europe about reducing our dependence on the USA for our security?</b><br>

                    “I think that such a discussion has been stimulated, based on discussions in the UK Parliament and
                    among the major European countries. The reality, however, is that without a substantial additional
                    commitment to defense spending by our European NATO allies, reality will continue to constrain what
                    might be done in the absence of US involvement.”</p>

                <p class="phototextarticle"><b>Do you believe that American foreign policy has over time just become
                        more of an expression of the
                        domestic political scene?</b><br>
                    “Of course, there is always an understandable relationship between domestic politics and our foreign
                    policy. That is inevitable and it is appropriate. The adage that ‘politics stops at the water’s
                    edge’ may have been true many decades ago, but seldom in more recent years. That said, I’m not sure
                    that I would agree that foreign policy has become ‘more of an expression of the domestic political
                    scene’. Rather, I would contend that domestic politics can influence more or less, depending on the
                    situation, the case at hand, the relationship between the White House and America’s legislative
                    bodies.”</p>

                <p class="phototextarticle"><b>Now that US and Nato forces are withdrawing militarily from Afghanistan,
                        what leverage do you believe the West could use to pressure the Taliban to induce them to
                        respect basic human rights
                        and to not harbour terrorist groups?</b><br>
                    “The US and the West will have enormous financial leverage; in fact, Afghanistan’s foreign assets
                    and its IMF special drawing rights have been frozen, and the Taliban are about to encounter a very
                    significant fiscal hole, without any means of generating significant funds (even with the addition
                    of the proceeds of the illegal narcotics trade that they have long controlled), unless some other
                    country might be willing to write a very substantial cheque with little hope of repayment. It is
                    possible that China, which has long understandably sought access to Afghanistan’s vast
                    mineral wealth, might provide much greater assistance than in the past. But the need will be so
                    considerable that it is unlikely to be met without the US, Japan, the UK, and other major donor
                    nations coming together to help. Beyond that, of course, the US and coalition countries also have
                    considerable military capability, despite the withdrawal, should that be needed. And, of course,
                    there are various other tools available, such as sanctions, diplomatic initiatives, and so forth.
                    The
                    Taliban are about to encounter a very significant fiscal hole, without any means of generating
                    significant funds.”</p>

                <p class="phototextarticle"><b>In the UK, the Johnson government has promoted the idea of a post-Brexit
                        ‘Global Britain’ that tilts to the Indo-Pacific region, so in an international crisis such as
                        this one, what type of role
                        should the UK be performing?</b><br>
                    “The UK has considerable capabilities in the world of international diplomacy, as a major donor
                    nation, in its often important role as a ‘convening power’ (especially having just hosted the G7),
                    and given its military capability, development funding, and support for democratic values, among
                    others. And the very close relationship between the US and the UK has often given additional
                    influence to the UK, as well. All countries are ‘rebalancing’ to the Indo-Pacific, with the current
                    US Administration impressively leading the effort to develop a coherent, comprehensive,
                    whole-of-governments approach for the critical relationship with China.”</p>
